        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Akash</strong>, and I am a passionate software engineer with a deep interest in technology and innovation. Over the past 2 years, I have worked with diverse technologies, solving complex problems, and creating high-quality software that makes a difference. My goal is to continuously learn and grow in the ever-evolving tech world.</p>
        
        <p>I have a strong foundation in web development, both frontend and backend, and enjoy building full-stack applications. In addition to technical skills, I believe in the importance of teamwork, communication, and a positive work environment, which enables me to collaborate effectively in diverse teams.</p>

        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking or reading. I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities that push my limits and help me become better at what I do. If you're looking for a dedicated and versatile software engineer, I would love to connect and explore how I can contribute to your team or project.</p>
